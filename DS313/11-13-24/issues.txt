==== ISSUES ====

1. Obvious inconsistent propagated data
  - Columns like author.book_count have a default value of zero even though there are probably book instances that refer to their author.author_id
  - Other columns with the same problems: book.rating,	book.num_of_reviews
  - Easily solved by making UPDATE statements, export to CSV and then reintegrate that data.

2. Foreign key constraints are not enforced
  - I observed na dili siya enforced even though naa siya sa schema. ðŸ¤”
  - Example: inserting a book with an author_id that doesn't exist in the author table
